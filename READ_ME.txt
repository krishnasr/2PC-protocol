To run the code 
1. Open Assignment 2 folder.
2. Open new terminal/cmd to the Assignment 2 file path.
3. run the command "python mast.py".
4. then open another new terminal/cmd to the Assignment 2 file path.
5. run the command "python partici_1.py".
6. then open another new terminal/cmd to the Assignment 2 file path.
7. run the command "python partici_2.py".
8. then open another new terminal/cmd to the Assignment 2 file path.
9. run the command "python partici_3.py".
10. then open another new terminal/cmd to the Assignment 2 file path.
11. run the command "python client.py".

12. You need to run 5 files each in separate terminal/cmd in this order, mast.py -> partici_1.py -> partici_2.py -> partici_3.py -> client.py

13. you can do the following process, new key, add key offset, sub key offset, del key, crash node_id,recover node_id, exit.
	For example client> new ezreal
		    client> add yasuo 10 
		    client> del yasuo 
[NOTE: If some error encountered while running the code please close all terminals and redo the steps mentioned above and run the code again.]
